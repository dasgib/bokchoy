Grilled cheese: The Detox
============


Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 cup of goat feta
- a few sprigs of parsley
- 2 slices of wholegrain sourdough
- 1/2 cup of quick pickled yellow squash
- a few slices of quick pickled red onions


Preparation
-----------

To begin, lay on half of that delicious goat feta - spreading it slightly apart so that it's not too overwhelming.

If you've only ever had typical feta then you are in for a treat. Fo'real. I'm totally obsessed with French goat version because it's much sweeter than the typical salty brands that you buy from the store. It's much more balanced and the texture is amazing. It melts in your mouth but also holds up when you cut it. It's the shizzzz!

Next add your pickled squash and onions. These veggies are slightly sweet but also tangy and they taste super duper fresh. So when your mouth tastes like a dirty old beer can, it's the perfect solution!

To make a quick pickle, sprinkle equal parts sugar and salt (go pinch by pinch) and toss with your veggies. Finish with a few splashes of red wine vinegar and let it sit for about five minutes. It's so easy and delicious. You'll be using this quick little recipe all the time. I just know it.

Then add the rest of the feta and the top piece of bread and get ready to be refreshed!

Butter both sides of the bread and turn your burner to medium. You should probably take this waiting time to call your parents to let them know you're ok. Two birds one stone... ya know?

Then once it starts to get all crispy and irresistible, flip it and repeat.

Once it's all purdy on both sides, take it off and cut it and eat immediately! You don't even need to wait with this grilled cheese because the feta isn't really going to change its texture - it's just going to get hot and delicious. Don't cry! Don't be scared that it'll ooze out everywhere!
